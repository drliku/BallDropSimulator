    body: <>Both clocks start at zero at event O, when the ship passes Earth. The ship clock shows its <Term tip={TIPS.properTime}>proper time</Term> to the ship's current event E. The Earth clock shows the time Earth's frame assigns between O and E, read from Earth-frame clocks synchronized with Earth's own.</>,

  {
    title: 'Neither clock is broken',
    body: <>Every clock aboard, whether mechanical, atomic, or biological, records the same proper time, and each works perfectly. Time dilation is a property of space-time geometry, not a malfunction or an effect of motion on the mechanism.</>,

  {
    title: 'No frame is "really" slower',
    body: <>From Earth the ship clock runs slow; from the ship, Earth's runs slow. Both are correct because they compare different pairs of events. Switch to the ship frame to see how <Term tip={TIPS.simultaneity}>simultaneity</Term> resolves it.</>,

    title: 'Not the full twin paradox',
    body: <>This is a one-way trip at constant velocity. The twins only disagree unambiguously about who aged less when they meet again, which needs the ship to turn around and change inertial frames.</>,

    title: 'Light speed is a hard limit',
    body: <>γ grows without bound as v → c, and so would the energy needed to accelerate further. Anything with mass stays below c, which is why the slider stops at 99.9%.</>,

    title: 'Animation is not velocity',
    body: <>Simulation speed only changes how fast the experiment plays back. Star streaks and photon speeds are illustrations. The clocks, scale bar, statistics, and graph use exact values with c = 299,792,458 m/s and Julian years.</>,
